      <p>I like JavaScript because of the versatility... but I actually like anything front-end related.</p>
      <p>That includes using HTML & CSS but also on-page SEO, CI/CD pipelines or other languages such as Flutter / Dart.<br/>
      When I hear or read some rant about CSS and how bad it is; I can't find myself in the reasoning behind it. I believe CSS is fantastic language.<br/>
      Call me old school but I like to seperate lay-out from behavior...<br/>
      but hey, the reason I'm still in development after all these years? <strong>Adaptability</strong></p>
