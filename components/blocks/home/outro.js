        I like JavaScript because of the versatility... but I actually like
        anything front-end related.
      </p>
      <p>
        That includes using HTML & CSS but also on-page SEO, CI/CD pipelines or
        other languages such as Flutter / Dart.
        <br />
        When I hear or read some rant about CSS and how bad it is; I can't find
        myself in the reasoning behind it. I believe CSS is fantastic language.

        The reason I'm still in development after all these years?
        <strong>Adaptability</strong>
        <br />
        The development industry is moving at a frantic pace, and developers
        need to keep on learning & adapting... including myself.
